AIAIART course


This repo will house the notebooks used for version 1 of the AIAIART course, which ran via Discord in September/October 2021. In time I hope to add part 2 of the course and possibly re-work the content into smaller chunks to suit asynchronous learning platforms. 

For now, the videos for the first run of the course are here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23FjyM69j910zCdDFVWcjSIKHbSB7NE8 (colab links in the descriptions should work until I add the notebooks here and check that they still run)
